E-commerce Price Tracker:

Create a Python tool that monitors the prices of products on e-commerce websites like Amazon, eBay, or Walmart.
Implement web scraping techniques using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract product information, including prices, ratings, and availability.
Set up automated tasks to periodically scrape product data and compare prices over time, alerting users when there are price drops or promotions.
Integrate with notification services like email or SMS to notify users of price changes and provide links to the product pages for quick purchase.
Allow users to track multiple products, set price thresholds, and customize notification settings to suit their preferences.
